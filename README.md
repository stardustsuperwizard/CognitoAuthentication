# Cognito Authentication with Lambda

## About
This is a basic Authentication and Authorization flow using AWS services API Gateway, Cognito, and Lambda. 

To build this:
* Import the Lambda files into AWS Lambda
* Setup a Cognito User Pool with an account
* Create API Gateways for all Lambda functions

This could be useful in a Python Flask app as well for authenticating a user.
